- **Flexible Integration**: Offers flexible integration options for large datasets
- **Secure Upload**: Secure upload mechanisms ensure data integrity throughout the process

#### Instruction Customization
- **Detailed Guidelines**: Submitters can provide highly detailed and customized labeling instructions
- **Examples and Edge Cases**: Include examples, edge case handling, and quality metrics
- **Clear Requirements**: Ensure that labelers understand the precise requirements of the task

#### File Management and Export
- **Easy Export**: Once validation is complete and the data is finalized, submitters can easily export their labeled datasets
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for various industry-standard formats
- **Secure Storage**: The decentralized storage ensures secure and efficient file retrieval

#### Communication Channel
- **Feedback Loop**: Facilitate clarifications, feedback, and project adjustments
- **Real-time Updates**: Stay informed about project developments

## Labeler Dashboard

The Labeler Dashboard is the central hub for annotators to find, execute, and manage their labeling tasks. It is designed to be intuitive, efficient, and rewarding.

### Key Features

#### Work Discovery and Selection
- **Project Browser**: Labelers can browse a wide array of available labeling projects
- **Skill Matching**: Choose work that aligns with your expertise and interests

#### Intuitive Labeling Tools
- **Advanced Tool Suite**: The dashboard provides a suite of advanced, user-friendly labeling tools
- **Multi-modal Support**: Tailored tools for different data modalities:
- **Efficiency Focused**: Tools designed to maximize efficiency and accuracy

#### Specialized Domain Tasks
OANICAI goes beyond basic annotation by offering specialized tasks that reflect real-world industry demand. These modules provide hands-on opportunities for labelers to contribute to high-value datasets:

- **Named Entity Recognition in Healthcare**:  
  A long-text input interface where labelers can highlight diseases, drugs, and symptoms in clinical notes or research articles. This creates structured data that supports medical AI applications.

- **Image Research in Crypto and DeFi**:  
  Labelers review blockchain screenshots, such as wallet or transaction records, and determine if suspicious activity is present. External research through tools like Etherscan or BscScan may be required, with responses captured as simple Yes or No answers.

- **Text Classification for Crypto Content**:  
  Short blurbs from platforms like Twitter, Telegram, or Discord are presented, and labelers classify them as scam or legitimate, or evaluate sentiment as positive or negative. These annotations feed into fraud detection and sentiment analysis models.

- **Relation Extraction in Finance and Fraud**:  
  A text reader allows labelers to highlight two entities, such as a person and a company, and assign their relationship (e.g., “owned by”, “transferred funds to”). These structured links help map fraud networks and financial dependencies.

- **Additional High-Demand Tasks**:  
  Lightweight but impactful labeling projects are also available, including fake news detection, spam and phishing email tagging, review sentiment analysis, product categorization, and toxic comment labeling. These tasks are simple to perform but critical for training robust AI systems.

#### Real-time Feedback and Guidance
- **Instant Feedback**: During the labeling process, labelers receive real-time feedback based on instructions
- **AI Suggestions**: In future phases, AI suggestions will help maintain quality and improve skills
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in quality checks to prevent common errors

#### Progress Tracking and Earnings
- **Task Management**: Track progress on ongoing tasks and view completed projects
- **Earnings Monitor**: Monitor earnings in OANIC tokens with transparent payment system
- **Performance Metrics**: View your accuracy rates and improvement over time

#### Skill Development Integration
- **Academy Access**: Direct links and integration with the OANICAI Academy
- **Continuous Learning**: Continuously upskill and qualify for more complex tasks
- **Career Progression**: Access higher-paying tasks as your skills improve

## Validator Dashboard
